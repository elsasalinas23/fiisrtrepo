@channel :rocket: Welcome to Per Scholas! Your Coding Journey Starts Tomorrow!
Hi everyone,
Welcome to the beginning of an exciting journey at Per Scholas! :tada: Tomorrow marks Day 1 of your coding bootcamp, and I couldn’t be more excited to have you here. Over the next few months, you’ll build technical skills, develop a problem-solving mindset, and gain real-world experience as you work toward becoming a software engineer.
But just as importantly, you’ll be joining a supportive community—one that learns, grows, and lifts each other up every step of the way.
Here’s what you need to know for tomorrow:
:date: Date: Tomorrow, July 14th
 :clock9: Time: 9:00 AM EST — Please sign in 15 minutes early!
 :link: Zoom Link: Join here
How to Prepare:
 :white_check_mark: Be ready to participate—this is a hands-on learning environment
 :white_check_mark: Have your computer, charger, and a notebook ready
 :white_check_mark: Log in early and make sure everything is working
 :white_check_mark: Set up a quiet, distraction-free workspace
 :white_check_mark: Get excited to meet your classmates and start coding!
This journey will be challenging, but also incredibly rewarding—and you won’t be doing it alone. I can’t wait to see what we’ll build together!
If you have any questions before class starts, don’t hesitate to reach out.
See you tomorrow! :rocket:
